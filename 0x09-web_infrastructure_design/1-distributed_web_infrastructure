# Components and their Roles:

    Server 1 (Web Server):
        This server hosts the Nginx web server, which handles incoming HTTP requests.
        It serves static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

    Server 2 (Application Server):
        This server runs the application server responsible for processing dynamic content and executing the website's code.
        It interacts with the database server for data retrieval and updates.

    Server 3 (Load Balancer - HAproxy):
        HAproxy acts as a load balancer, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers.
        It enables high availability, load distribution, and improves the system's fault tolerance.

    Application Files (Your Code Base):
        This set of application files includes your website's codebase, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code.

    Database Server (MySQL):
        MySQL serves as the database, storing and managing website data.
        It facilitates data retrieval and updates, essential for the application's functionality.



# Issues with this Infrastructure:

    Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
        The load balancer is a potential single point of failure. If it fails, traffic distribution will be disrupted.
        Security and monitoring components are also single points of failure.

    Security Issues:
        No mention of a firewall or security measures to protect the servers and database.
        Lack of HTTPS could expose data to potential security risks.

    No Monitoring:
        There's no monitoring solution mentioned to track the performance, health, and security of the infrastructure and to respond to issues proactively.

To enhance this infrastructure, consider adding redundancy for the load balancer, implementing security measures (firewall, HTTPS), and incorporating monitoring tools to address potential issues and maintain system health.
