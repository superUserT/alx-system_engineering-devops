# Components and their Roles:

    Server:
        A server is a computer that hosts and serves resources to other computers, in this case, a website. It listens for incoming requests and responds accordingly.
        In our case, it's a single server responsible for hosting the entire web application.

    Domain Name:
        The domain name (www.foobar.com) is a human-friendly way to identify a website. It's a string that maps to an IP address.
        It is essential for users to access your website by typing a memorable name rather than an IP address.

    DNS Record:
        The "www" in www.foobar.com represents a DNS (Domain Name System) record called a "subdomain."
        It specifies that the subdomain "www" is associated with the domain foobar.com and should point to your server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

    Web Server (Nginx):
        Nginx is a web server that handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content, performs load balancing, and can also act as a reverse proxy.
        It receives requests from users' web browsers and routes them to the application server.

    Application Server:
        The application server is responsible for processing dynamic content and executing the website's code.
        It can run server-side code, interact with the database, and generate dynamic HTML content.
        It receives requests from the web server and sends responses back to the web server.

    Application Files (Your Code Base):
        This includes your website's codebase, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any server-side code (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) that is required for the website to function.

    Database (MySQL):
        The database stores and manages the website's data. It can be used to store user information, content, and other data that needs to persist.
        The application server communicates with the database to retrieve and update data when required.



# Issues with this Infrastructure:

    Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
        This infrastructure has a single server, which means if the server fails, the entire website goes down. There's no redundancy or failover mechanism.

    Downtime During Maintenance:
        When performing maintenance or deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted. This can result in downtime, disrupting user access.

    Limited Scalability:
        With only one server, it cannot efficiently handle a sudden increase in traffic. Scaling horizontally by adding more servers is necessary to ensure high availability and performance under heavy loads.

To address these issues, you can consider implementing load balancing, redundancy, and a scalable infrastructure, which would involve multiple servers, database replication, and more advanced configurations
