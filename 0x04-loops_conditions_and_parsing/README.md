# Background Context

This project focuses on Bash scripting, specifically covering loops, conditions, and parsing. It aims to enhance your skills in creating and managing Bash scripts.
Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain the knowledge and skills to:

    Create SSH keys
    Understand the advantages of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
    Use while, until, and for loops
    Work with if, else, elif, and case condition statements
    Utilize the cut command
    Use file and other comparison operators

# Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    All your Bash script files must be executable
    You are not allowed to use awk
    Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
    The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
    The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

Shellcheck

    Shellcheck is a tool that helps you write proper Bash scripts.
    All your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error to earn points on the task.

Project Tasks

    Create a SSH RSA key pair
        Create an RSA key pair and share your public key as 0-RSA_public_key.pub.
        Fill the SSH public key field of your intranet profile with the generated public key.
        Keep the private key secure for later use.
        Optionally, add a passphrase to your key and store it securely.

    For Best School loop
        Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a for loop.

    While Best School loop
        Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.

    Until Best School loop
        Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using an until loop.

    If 9, say Hi!
        Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays "Hi" on a new line.

    4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
        Write a Bash script that loops from 1 to 10 and displays specific messages for the 4th and 8th iterations, and "Best School" for the rest.

    Superstitious numbers
        Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and shows different messages for specific iterations using a case statement.

    Clock
        Write a Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes using a while loop.

    To file, or not to file
        Write a Bash script that provides information about the "school" file, checking if it exists, if it's empty, and if it's a regular file.

    FizzBuzz
        Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz," multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and other numbers as is.
